### Docker compose

The directory *deployments/docker* contains docker compose files allowing to run the backend service and the frontend
locally. **The mandatory environment variables must be set before executing docker compose**

To run the backend and its MongoDB database, execute the following docker compose command:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

To run the backend, its MongoDB database and the frontend, execute the following docker compose command:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-fe.yaml up

Once activated, Siron Activate will export telemetry data on **http://localhost:4317**. This value can be adapted
to your environment with following environment variable.

```
QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://my-otel.collector.imtf.com:4317
```
